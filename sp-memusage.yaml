Description: |
    This package provides a collection of memory usage monitoring tools and scripts.
      - Mallinfo library outputs values from the Glibc mallinfo() function, either
        with SIGUSR1 like libleaks, or at given intervals. I.e. it tells how much
        allocated and freed (but not returned to system) memory is in the C-library
        memory pool for the process.  You can use this to detect memory
        fragmentation.
      - mem-*monitor* tools output system and process memory (and CPU) usage
        overviews at specified intervals.
      - There are also some extra scripts to get memory usage details from
        processes.
     Manual pages tell more about the tools and scripts.
